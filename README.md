### About HTML Forms
Fundamental part of HTML is being able to develop forms which can later be used to gather data.
This data can then be stored in a database and used to improve the product or service to meet consumer demands.
This repository serves as an example form developed in HTML.
This form can later be improved to demonstrate good practices in gathering and storing user data.

**Useful Links for HTML Forms:**

## Note for Future Improvement:
- **Incorporating CSS:** Add CSS to make the webpage more visually appealing and aligned with the aesthetic of the theme.
- **Integrating JavaScript:** Enhance user engagement and provide a more immersive experience for visitors through the use of JavaScript.
- **Responsive Design:** Improve accessibility and usability for a wider range of users by optimizing for a wide range of screen sizes.
- **Accessibility Features:** Ensure keyboard navigation and utilize ARIA attributes to make the webpage more usable for individuals with disabilities.
- **Develop Database:** Collect data using HTML forms and safely store that data within a database.
